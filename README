Seed
====

A plugin to help with generating and/or inserting seed data into your database.  Seed will
generate data for you or load it from fixtures or arbitrary Yaml, CSV, or (eventually) XML
files.  The basic workflow goes like this:

1. Create seed files.  These live in db/seeds/ and are named for the tables of your models, 
like Person (model), people (table) would yield people_seed.rb.

2. Create a class named for the file (people_seed.rb would have PeopleSeed) that inherits from
+Seed::Planter+.

3. Fill in your directives for attributes or file loads, or you can leave it empty and Seed will
enumerate your columns and generate data for you.

You can also generate static versions of the seeds for your current models using the db:seeds:generate
Rake task.

Examples
========

    # db/seeds/products_seed.rb
    class ProductsSeed < Seed::Planter
      attribute :name, :string
      
      # Address attribute types are special and generate
      # proper data.
      attribute :address, :address
      
      # An email attribute will generate an e-mail address.
      attribute :email, :email      
    end

    # db/seeds/people_seed.rb
    class PeopleSeed < Seed::Planter
      # Tells Seed that you want to load seed data from
      # the file db/seeds/people.yml
      loads_from "people.yml"
    end
    
    # db/seeds/things_seed.rb
    class ThingsSeed < Seed::Planter
      # Tells Seed that you want to load seed data from
      # the fixtures file (test/fixtures/things.yml)
      loads_from :fixtures
    end
